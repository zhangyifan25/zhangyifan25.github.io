  <p>
    I am a PhD student majoring in Electronic Information at Beihang University.<br/>
    My supervisors are Prof.<a href="https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B175ENBJ/" target="_blank">Zhiguo Jiang(姜志国)</a>. and Prof.<a href="https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-B175RPOJ/" target="_blank">Haopeng Zhang</a>..<br/>
    My research interests mainly lie in weakly supervised semantic segmentation of remote sensing images and visual language large-scale models. If you are passionate about these topics, please feel free to contact me at any time by sending an email to zb2557237@buaa.edu.cn

    I am currently visiting UC Berkeley and <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley AI Research (BAIR)</a>, 
    working with <a href="https://geng-haoran.github.io" target="_blank">Haoran Geng</a> and advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/" target="_blank">Jitendra Malik</a> and Prof. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a>.

    Previously, I had the privilege to work as an undergraduate research intern under the supervision of Prof. 
    <a href="https://yuewang.xyz/" target="_blank">Yue Wang</a>.

  <p>
    My interests focus on Robot Learning and Embodied Intelligence, with a focus on how robots can <strong>acquire and use world knowledge</strong> to act reliably in open-ended environments, and how this process can become a <strong>data flywheel for scalable robotic systems</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leveraging Human World Knowledge for Scalable Robotic Perception</strong>: How to make use of multiple sources of data such as human demonstrations, foundation models, Internet data, and synthetic data? How to leverage these abundant, low-cost data into universal perceptual priors for scalable robotic systems?</li>
    <li><strong>Robotic Action and Interaction</strong>: How to understand the modality of action, thus unifying low-level control with high-level reasoning? How can we model the semantics, dependencies, and affordances of robotic actions to seek robust and generalizable robotic behavior?</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning for Embodied Knowledge Acquisition</strong>: How can we scale RL to turn it into an engine for autonomous robotic data collection, forming a self-improving data flywheel that continually strengthens generalizability of robotic perception and control?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong style="color: red;">I am seeking a Ph.D. position starting from Fall 2026!</strong> Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or have any questions!
